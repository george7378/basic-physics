Basic Physics is a very simple rigid body physics simulation, designed to show the minimal code needed for 3D dynamics of cube-like objects. It uses MonoGame for graphical rendering.

The simulation shows a symmetrical cube falling under gravity, and interacting with a flat plane. The collisions are handled using a 'penalty method', which allows for easy modelling of impacts and friction.
